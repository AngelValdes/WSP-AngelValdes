                    <h2>Image/Video slider</h2>
                    <img src="components/2/imagevideoslider.jpg"/>
                    <h3>WHAT I HOPE TO PRACTICE/LEARN?</h3>
                    <p>Image and video sliders are a way to make the website become alive. It also provides and easy place to display multiple images with a better use of real state. Many of thise images or videos can have messages and call to action.</p>
                    <h3>HOW THIS RELATES TO WHAT I HAVE/WILL LEARN IN WDD?</h3>
                    <p>We are learning about the web stardards and technologies. Image/video sliders are a very common and standard way to display images and videos in the web. It could change images automatically or allow the user to change them manually. Many of them can have messages, information, and even links to pages. Some times they also have controls to disable volume and pagination.</p>

                    <h2>Tabs</h2>
                    <img src="components/3/Tabs.jpg"/>
                    <h3>WHAT I HOPE TO PRACTICE/LEARN?</h3>
                    <p>Tabs allow us to display a lot more information than what it would normally feet in the screen at one time, but it will only display if you chose the category or section where that informaiton belongs to. This allows us to manage our screen realstate better and eliminate clutering.</p>
                    <h3>HOW THIS RELATES TO WHAT I HAVE/WILL LEARN IN WDD?</h3>
                    <p>There are many best practices to organize information in the screen, eliminating duplication, confusion, and promoting clarity. Web standards are many time created to offer best practices and solutions to common problems. Tabs are one way to implement those best practices.</p>

                    <h2>Accordions/Panels</h2>
                    <img src="components/4/Accordions.jpg"/>
                    <h3>WHAT I HOPE TO PRACTICE/LEARN?</h3>
                    <p>Accordions and panels, similar to tabs allows me to better use the screen real state. It is also use to focus the attention of the user to specific information. Accordions would had been a great solution for this page, where each of this controls would be inside one of the accordions panels, and so possibly making this page fit in the screen without having to scroll down.</p>
                    <h3>HOW THIS RELATES TO WHAT I HAVE/WILL LEARN IN WDD?</h3>
                    <p>We have also study about this accordions as well as many more web controls in previous courses. You can find vertical and horizontal accordions.</p>
                    <div class="button">
                        <a href="components/4/component.html" target="_blank">view component</a>

                    <h2>Always visible panel</h2>
                    <img src="components/5/AlwaysVisible.jpg"/>
                    <h3>WHAT I HOPE TO PRACTICE/LEARN?</h3>
                    <p>Always visible panels are very nice for when you want the user to scroll up and down without losing touch to a specific information. This could be a shopping cart or a totals calculations, or some important information. As the user scrolls, the panel will keep its position in the screen, completly independent from the scrolling action.</p>
